### Focus Areas:
* MVVM architecture - Clear separation of logic and UI.
* Caching - fetch from the disk instead calling network
* Functional changes - Implemented a modular design with reusable components for scalability.
* Unit Testing â€“ Ensured code reliability through test coverage.

### Time spent on this project
Spent approx 4-5 hours 
- Architecture and design ~ 1 hr
- Caching & networking ~ 1 - 1.5 hr
- UI ~ 1hr
- Unit testing ~1hr
- Documentation ~0.5hr


### Trade-offs and Decisions: 
* Used only disk caching and no in-memory caching to keep it minimal 
* Used three JSON files to toggle between success, malformed, and empty states depending on the user settings. 
* Although originally designed as a single-page app, added tab navigation for better organization.
* Included a Settings page to manage developer options, such as switching response types and clearing image caches.

### What could be improved?
* Unreliable cache directory: I used cache directory which can be cleared by the system during low storage which makes it unreliable for long-term storage. Also could have used in-memory cache NSCache for fast access.
* No cache invalidation: There is no cache invalidation logic if images gets updated, the cached version would continue to use the outdated data unless cleared cached from Settings. It would be 
* Better UI for detail page
